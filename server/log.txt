response 
1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The simplified MVP version of this startup idea would be a platform that connects local farmers with restaurants and grocery stores, allowing businesses to purchase fresh, locally-sourced produce. This feature is worth testing because it would reduce food waste and provide businesses with access to fresh, locally-sourced produce.

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The original idea included connecting local farmers with restaurants and grocery stores, providing fresh, locally-sourced produce to businesses and reducing food waste. The simplified MVP version removed the provision of fresh, locally-sourced produce to businesses as this was not necessary for the testing of the platform's ability to connect local farmers with restaurants and grocery stores.

1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The simplified MVP version of this startup idea would be to focus on the private mode feature, allowing members to host parties that are invite-only.

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The public mode feature has been removed from the original idea in order to focus on the private mode feature. This is because the private mode feature allows for a more exclusive experience, which could be attractive to users who want to have a more intimate gathering.

response 

1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The MVP version of this startup idea should focus on providing low-income people with access to financial education and resources that can help them save an extra few hundred dollars monthly. This feature is worth testing because it can help low-income people gain the knowledge and resources they need to make better financial decisions and increase their savings. 

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The original idea was focused on helping low-income people save an extra few hundred dollars monthly, but the simplified MVP version removes the focus on saving money and instead focuses on providing financial education and resources to help them make better financial decisions. This was removed because providing access to financial education is a more effective way of helping low-income people save money in the long run than simply trying to encourage them to save a few hundred dollars each month.

VC's that invest in this space with 2-3 startup names they invested In North America, Europe, Middle East, South America, Africa; 4. list of 5 notable competitors with links to their websites in this space in above regions?: Emilsifiers

response 
1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The simplified MVP version of this startup idea would be to develop an emulsifier that is specifically designed for use in food products. This feature would be worth testing because it could potentially provide a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce food products, as well as improve the quality of the end product.

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The original idea was to develop a range of emulsifiers for use in various industries, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food products. This has been removed because it is more feasible to focus on one specific industry at first, which in this case would be food products. This will allow the startup to focus their resources on developing a product that is tailored specifically for that industry, rather than trying to develop a product that can be used across multiple industries.

response 
1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The simplified MVP version of this startup idea would be to offer online baby sitting classes for college students. This feature is worth testing because it would provide college students with an easy and convenient way to learn the basics of baby sitting, which could help them gain valuable skills and experience in the field.

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The original idea was to offer baby sitting classes for college students in person, but this has been removed in order to simplify the MVP version. This was done because offering online classes is more cost-effective and can reach a larger audience than in-person classes.

response 
1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The simplified MVP version of this startup idea would be to offer online wine classes for retired people.

response 
1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The MVP version of this startup should focus on providing a platform for lonely retired people to connect with each other and arrange trips together. This feature is worth testing because it would allow the startup to quickly identify the needs of its target market and determine whether there is a viable business opportunity.

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The original idea was to open a speakeasy bar in Azerbaijan, which has been simplified to just opening the bar itself. This simplification was done because it allows the business to focus on testing the viability of the concept without having to worry about additional features or services that may not be necessary at this stage.

response 
1. Simplified MVP version of this startup idea with only one feature worth testing and why: The MVP version of this startup idea should focus on creating a database of cocktail recipes that can be easily accessed by speakeasy bar owners. This feature is worth testing because it would provide bar owners with an easy way to find new recipes and keep their customers interested in the drinks they offer.

2. Information on what has been removed from original idea and why: The original idea was to create a platform that would suggest cocktails for speakeasy bars based on customer preferences. This has been removed from the MVP version because it is not necessary for the initial testing phase, as it would require more complex algorithms and data collection than the basic database of recipes.
